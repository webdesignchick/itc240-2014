                <p> I am working towards a Web Design Certificate.  The more time I spend in these classes the more I think I may go for the Web Developer Certificate as well. </p>
                <p> In the course of my studies I have learned a lot of CSS and HTML.  I was nervous about working on a page without a template to start but as I worked on this page I realized that I have retained more knowledge then I thought.  I did have to look up a couple of CSS syntaxes such as the semicolon in the hover tag and the mailto for the A tag in the email link for my footer.</p>
                <p>  I love living in Seattle! My husband and I relocated to Seattle two years ago. I love the outdoors and I used to mountain bike and hike a lot before my surgery last year. I also used to do hair but my body and the doctor told me it wasn't such a good idea anymore. I love movies and reading. You will never find my Kindle far from hand and Saturday night is not complete without a few explosions from the latest action flick.</p>
